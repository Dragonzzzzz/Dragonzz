# Dragonzz
This is to end my five years of time-wasting, lazziness and negativeness. To work hard for what I want until the end of my day, from this day onwards. I had a 10 year agreement, for which I still have 4 years left. The next 4 years shall be harsh, both to compensate for the past and to build a meaningful future to my definition.
