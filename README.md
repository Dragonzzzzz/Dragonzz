# Dragonzz
This is to end my five years of time-wasting, lazziness, negativeness. To work hard for what I want until the end of the day, from this day onwards. I had a 10 year agreement, and I still have 4 years left. The next 4 years shall be harsh, to compensate for the past, and to build a meaningful future to my definition.
